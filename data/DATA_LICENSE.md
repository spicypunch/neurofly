# Data license

`connectome.json`, `neurons.bin`, and `synapses.bin` are derived from the
publicly released FlyWire connectome data products (FAFB v783), processed by
the upstream [SiliconFly ETL](https://github.com/dawsonamf/siliconfly/blob/8839d84cd24888a4251a2e227792b6f26fbee776/etl.py).
NeuroFly retains the manifest and retrieves the two binary files from that
pinned revision with `scripts/fetch-data.py`; they are not committed here.

Sources:

- **Neuron annotations, coordinates, cell types and neurotransmitters** —
  `classification.csv.gz`, `coordinates.csv.gz`,
  `consolidated_cell_types.csv.gz`, `neurons.csv.gz`, downloaded from
  [FlyWire Codex](https://codex.flywire.ai)
  (`https://storage.googleapis.com/flywire-data/codex/data/fafb/783`).
- **Connectivity** — `2025_Connectivity_783.parquet` from
  [eonsystemspbc/fly-brain](https://github.com/eonsystemspbc/fly-brain), an
  aggregation of FlyWire's `proofread_connections_783` release
  ([Zenodo 10676866](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10676866)) into
  15,091,983 (pre, post) synapse-count pairs with no threshold. It carries
  the same FlyWire CC BY-NC 4.0 terms as the Codex dumps.
